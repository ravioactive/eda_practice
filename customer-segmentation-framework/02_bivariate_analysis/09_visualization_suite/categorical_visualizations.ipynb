    "# Categorical Visualizations for Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Purpose\n",
    "This notebook focuses on creating comprehensive visualizations for categorical-categorical and categorical-numerical relationships in bivariate analysis. It provides specialized plotting techniques, statistical visualization methods, and interactive displays specifically designed for categorical data relationships, enabling clear communication of association patterns, dependencies, and business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comprehensive Analysis Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Contingency Table Visualizations**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Visual representation of cross-tabulations reveals association patterns and conditional distributions that are difficult to detect in raw tables\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Heatmaps, mosaic plots, and balloon plots show cell frequencies, standardized residuals, and contribution to chi-square statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Association Strength Visualizations**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Graphical display of association measures helps compare relationship strength across different variable pairs and business contexts\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Bar charts, radar plots, and coefficient matrices show Cram√©r's V, Phi coefficients, and other association measures with confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Mosaic and Marimekko Plots**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Area-based visualizations preserve marginal distributions while showing conditional relationships and interaction effects\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Rectangle sizes represent frequencies, colors show residuals, and patterns reveal independence deviations and association structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Correspondence Analysis Visualizations**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Dimensionality reduction for categorical data reveals hidden patterns and relationships in high-dimensional contingency tables\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Biplots show row and column categories in reduced space, with distances indicating similarity and angles showing associations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Stacked and Grouped Bar Charts**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Comparative visualizations show distribution differences across categories and highlight conditional probability patterns\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Heights represent frequencies or proportions, comparisons reveal group differences, and patterns indicate association strength\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Alluvial and Sankey Diagrams**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Flow-based visualizations track category transitions and show how observations move between different categorical states\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Flow thickness represents frequency, connections show transitions, and patterns reveal customer journey and behavior changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Treemap and Sunburst Charts**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Hierarchical visualizations show nested categorical relationships and multi-level segmentation structures\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Area sizes represent frequencies, hierarchies show category relationships, and colors indicate additional dimensions or metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Network-Based Category Visualizations**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Graph representations reveal complex categorical relationships and community structures within customer segments\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Nodes represent categories, edges show associations, and clustering reveals natural groupings and relationship patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Statistical Test Result Visualizations**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Visual representation of hypothesis test results and effect sizes makes statistical findings accessible to business stakeholders\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Forest plots show confidence intervals, p-value plots indicate significance patterns, and effect size charts show practical importance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Interactive Categorical Dashboards**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Dynamic exploration allows users to filter, drill-down, and investigate categorical relationships across different business dimensions\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Filters enable subset analysis, linked plots show coordinated views, and tooltips provide detailed statistical information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Comparative Categorical Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Side-by-side comparisons reveal differences between time periods, segments, or experimental conditions in categorical relationships\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Parallel plots show multiple comparisons, difference charts highlight changes, and statistical annotations indicate significance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Business-Oriented Categorical Displays**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Domain-specific visualizations translate statistical findings into actionable business insights and strategic recommendations\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Customer journey maps show transition probabilities, segment profiles display characteristic patterns, and ROI charts show business impact\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Publication-Quality Categorical Plots**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Professional visualizations ensure clear communication in reports, presentations, and academic publications\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Standardized formatting, appropriate color schemes, and clear annotations make findings accessible to diverse audiences\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Accessibility and Universal Design**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Inclusive visualizations ensure findings are accessible to users with different abilities and technical backgrounds\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Color-blind friendly palettes, alternative text, and multiple encoding channels make insights universally accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Comprehensive categorical visualization toolkit for bivariate relationships\n",
    "- Clear communication of association patterns and statistical findings\n",
    "- Interactive exploration capabilities for business stakeholders\n",
    "- Professional-quality plots ready for reports and presentations\n",
    "- Accessible visualizations following universal design principles\n"
