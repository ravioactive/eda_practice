    "# 🧪 **Two-Sample Statistical Tests for Customer Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🎯 Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive two-sample statistical testing for customer segmentation data, focusing on comparing numerical customer characteristics across categorical groups (e.g., gender-based spending differences). Two-sample tests are essential for validating business hypotheses, identifying significant group differences, and making data-driven decisions about customer targeting and segmentation strategies.\n",

    "## **🔍 Comprehensive Analysis Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Parametric Two-Sample Tests**\n",
    "- **Independent Samples T-Test**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests whether mean customer characteristics differ significantly between two groups (e.g., male vs female spending)\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** p < 0.05 indicates significant difference; t-statistic shows effect direction; assumes normality and equal variances\n",
    "- **Welch's T-Test (Unequal Variances)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Robust alternative when groups have unequal variances in customer characteristics\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** More reliable than standard t-test when variance assumption violated; degrees of freedom adjusted for unequal variances\n",
    "- **Paired Samples T-Test**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Compares related measurements (e.g., before/after intervention spending) within same customers\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Tests mean difference of paired observations; controls for individual customer differences; higher statistical power\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Non-Parametric Two-Sample Tests**\n",

    "- **Homogeneity of Variance Testing**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests equal variance assumption critical for standard t-tests\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Levene's test, F-test assess variance equality; violations require Welch's t-test or transformations\n",
    "- **Independence Assumption Validation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Ensures customer observations are independent within and between groups\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Critical for valid inference; violations require specialized methods (e.g., mixed models)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Multiple Comparisons and Corrections**\n",
    "- **Bonferroni Correction**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Controls family-wise error rate when testing multiple customer group comparisons\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Divides α by number of tests; conservative but protects against false discoveries\n",
    "- **False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Less conservative approach to multiple testing correction for exploratory customer analysis\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Controls expected proportion of false discoveries; better power than Bonferroni for many comparisons\n",
    "- **Holm-Bonferroni Sequential Method**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Step-down procedure that's less conservative than standard Bonferroni\n",

    "- **Two One-Sided Tests (TOST)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests whether customer groups are practically equivalent within specified bounds\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Demonstrates similarity rather than just absence of difference; important for business equivalence claims\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval Approach to Equivalence**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Uses confidence intervals to assess practical equivalence of customer groups\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** If CI falls within equivalence bounds, groups are practically equivalent; visual and intuitive\n",
