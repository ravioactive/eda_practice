    "- **Cliff's Delta for Non-Parametric Effect Size**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Effect size for Mann-Whitney U test and other rank-based comparisons\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Probability that random observation from one group exceeds random observation from other group\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Robust Group Comparison Methods**\n",
    "- **Trimmed Mean Comparisons**\n",

    "  - **Interpretation:** More representative of typical customers when extreme values are present\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Group Comparisons**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Distribution-free method for comparing groups without parametric assumptions\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Provides confidence intervals and p-values through resampling; robust to distributional violations\n",
    "- **Permutation Tests for Group Differences**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Exact tests that don't rely on distributional assumptions\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Particularly useful for small samples or unusual customer distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Multiple Group Comparisons (if applicable)**\n",
    "- **One-Way ANOVA (if additional categorical variables)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Compares means across multiple customer groups simultaneously\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Tests overall group differences; requires post-hoc tests to identify specific group pairs\n",
    "- **Kruskal-Wallis Test (Non-Parametric ANOVA)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Distribution-free alternative for comparing multiple groups\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Tests if at least one group differs; robust to non-normality and unequal variances\n",
    "- **Post-Hoc Multiple Comparison Procedures**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Controls family-wise error rate when making multiple pairwise comparisons\n",
