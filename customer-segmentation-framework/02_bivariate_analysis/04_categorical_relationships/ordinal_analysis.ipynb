    "\n",
    "## **üéØ Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive ordinal analysis techniques for customer segmentation data, focusing on analyzing relationships between ordinal customer variables that have natural ordering but unequal intervals. Ordinal analysis is essential for understanding customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and behavioral patterns that follow natural hierarchies, enabling more nuanced customer insights and targeted strategies based on ordered categorical relationships.\n",

    "### **1. Ordinal Variable Identification and Preparation**\n",
    "- **Natural Ordering Assessment**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Identifies customer variables with inherent ordering (satisfaction levels, income brackets, age groups)\n",
