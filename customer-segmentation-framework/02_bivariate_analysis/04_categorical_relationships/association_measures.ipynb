    "\n",
    "## **üéØ Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive association measurement techniques for categorical customer variables, focusing on quantifying the strength and nature of relationships between customer characteristics. Association measures are essential for understanding the magnitude of relationships beyond statistical significance, enabling data-driven decisions about customer segmentation, targeting strategies, and business resource allocation based on relationship strength.\n",
