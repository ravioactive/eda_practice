    "\n",
    "## **üéØ Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive rank-based correlation analysis for customer segmentation variables, providing robust measures of monotonic relationships that don't require normality assumptions. Rank correlations are essential for understanding customer behavior patterns when data distributions are skewed or contain outliers.\n",

    "### **1. Spearman Rank Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "- **Age vs Income Spearman Correlation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Captures monotonic relationship without assuming linearity or normality\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** œÅ > 0 indicates customers with higher age ranks tend to have higher income ranks; robust to outliers\n",
    "- **Age vs Spending Score Spearman Correlation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Reveals monotonic spending patterns across customer age groups\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Strong positive œÅ suggests older customers consistently spend more; negative œÅ indicates younger high spenders\n",
    "- **Income vs Spending Score Spearman Correlation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Most critical relationship for understanding spending capacity vs behavior\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High œÅ confirms income drives spending behavior; low œÅ suggests other factors influence spending decisions\n",

    "- **Spearman Correlation Significance Tests**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Determines if observed rank correlations are statistically significant\n",

    "- **Kendall's Tau Significance Testing**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests significance of Kendall's tau using exact or asymptotic methods\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** More conservative than Spearman tests; appropriate for smaller customer samples\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for Rank Correlations**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Provides uncertainty bounds without distributional assumptions\n",
