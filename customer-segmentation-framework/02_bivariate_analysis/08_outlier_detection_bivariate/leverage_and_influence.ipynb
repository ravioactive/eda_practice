    "\n",
    "## **🎯 Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive leverage and influence analysis for customer segmentation data, focusing on identifying customers who have unusual predictor values (leverage) or disproportionate impact on statistical models (influence).
