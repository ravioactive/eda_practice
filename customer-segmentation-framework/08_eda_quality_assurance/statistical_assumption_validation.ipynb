    "# Statistical Assumption Validation and Method Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Purpose\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive statistical assumption validation and methodological verification for customer data analysis, ensuring analytical validity and appropriate method selection. It provides systematic approaches to test statistical assumptions, validate analytical methods, and ensure robust inference in customer segmentation and relationship analysis.\n",
