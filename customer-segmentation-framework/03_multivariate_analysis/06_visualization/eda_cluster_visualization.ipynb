    "## Comprehensive Analysis Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Cluster Separation and Boundary Visualization**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Visual representation of cluster boundaries and separation helps assess clustering quality and understand segment distinctiveness\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Clear boundaries indicate well-separated clusters, overlap regions show ambiguous assignments, and separation distance indicates cluster distinctiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Dendogram and Hierarchical Cluster Displays**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Hierarchical clustering visualizations reveal nested cluster structures and help determine optimal cluster numbers\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Tree height indicates dissimilarity levels, branch patterns show cluster relationships, and cut points determine final segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Cluster Validation Visualization**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Visual assessment of cluster quality through silhouette plots, elbow curves, and validation metrics provides objective clustering evaluation\n",
