    "\n",
    "## Notebook Purpose\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive multivariate classification techniques for customer prediction and segmentation, providing advanced modeling approaches that handle multiple features simultaneously and enable sophisticated customer behavior prediction. It focuses on building robust, interpretable classification models that translate customer characteristics into actionable predictions for business strategy and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comprehensive Analysis Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Multivariate Logistic Regression**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Logistic regression provides interpretable baseline classification with clear coefficient interpretation and statistical inference capabilities\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Coefficients show variable effects, odds ratios indicate impact magnitude, and confidence intervals provide uncertainty estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Discriminant analysis provides optimal classification when assumptions are met and offers interpretable discriminant functions\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Discriminant functions show separation patterns, classification accuracy measures performance, and variable importance guides feature understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Support Vector Machine Classification**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: SVM handles non-linear classification boundaries and high-dimensional data effectively through kernel methods\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Decision boundaries show classification regions, support vectors identify critical observations, and kernel choice affects boundary complexity\n",

    "### 6. **Neural Network Classification**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Neural networks capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions in customer data for sophisticated classification\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Hidden layer activations reveal learned representations, feature importance shows input relevance, and network architecture affects complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Naive Bayes Classification**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Naive Bayes provides fast, interpretable classification with good performance when independence assumptions approximately hold\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Conditional probabilities show feature effects, class priors reflect base rates, and likelihood ratios indicate discriminative power\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: KNN provides non-parametric classification based on local similarity, adapting to local data patterns\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Neighborhood composition shows local patterns, distance metrics affect similarity definition, and k-parameter controls local vs global influence\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Classification Model Validation and Performance**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Rigorous validation ensures model reliability and provides unbiased estimates of classification performance\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Accuracy metrics show overall performance, precision/recall reveal class-specific performance, and ROC curves show discriminative ability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Multiclass and Multilabel Classification**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Extension to multiple classes and labels enables complex customer categorization and multi-dimensional prediction\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Confusion matrices show class-specific performance, macro/micro averages provide overall metrics, and class imbalance affects interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Probabilistic Classification and Uncertainty**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Probabilistic outputs provide prediction confidence and enable decision-making under uncertainty\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Prediction probabilities show confidence, uncertainty measures guide reliability assessment, and calibration ensures probability accuracy\n",
