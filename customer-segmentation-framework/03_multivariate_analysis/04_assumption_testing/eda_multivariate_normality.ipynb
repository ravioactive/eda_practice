    "# Multivariate Normality Testing and Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Purpose\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive testing and assessment of multivariate normality assumptions, which are fundamental to many multivariate statistical procedures including MANOVA, discriminant analysis, and multivariate regression. It provides multiple approaches for detecting departures from multivariate normality and offers remedial strategies for handling violations in customer data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comprehensive Analysis Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mardia's Test for Multivariate Normality**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Mardia's test assesses multivariate skewness and kurtosis, providing comprehensive evaluation of multivariate normality assumptions\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Significant skewness indicates asymmetric distributions, significant kurtosis shows heavy or light tails, and combined tests assess overall normality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Henze-Zirkler Test**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Henze-Zirkler test provides a powerful omnibus test for multivariate normality based on empirical characteristic functions\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Test statistic measures deviation from normality, p-values indicate significance of departures, and the test is sensitive to various types of non-normality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Royston's Multivariate Normality Test**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Royston's test extends the Shapiro-Wilk test to the multivariate case, providing familiar univariate normality testing in multivariate context\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Test combines univariate normality assessments with correlation adjustments, H statistic indicates overall normality, and component tests show variable-specific departures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Energy Test for Multivariate Normality**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Energy tests provide distribution-free assessment of multivariate normality with good power properties across different alternatives\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Energy statistics measure distributional differences, bootstrap p-values provide significance assessment, and the test is robust to various departures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Graphical Assessment Methods**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Visual methods provide intuitive assessment of multivariate normality and help identify specific types of departures from normality\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Q-Q plots show distributional fit, chi-square plots reveal multivariate structure, and scatter plot matrices show bivariate normality patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Univariate Normality Component Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Assessing univariate normality for each variable provides insights into sources of multivariate non-normality\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Individual variable tests identify problematic variables, skewness and kurtosis measures show specific departures, and transformations target specific issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Mahalanobis Distance Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Mahalanobis distances should follow chi-square distribution under multivariate normality, providing diagnostic information\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Distance plots reveal distributional fit, outliers appear as extreme distances, and chi-square Q-Q plots show overall multivariate structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Transformation Assessment and Selection**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Transformations can improve multivariate normality, and assessment helps select appropriate transformation methods\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Box-Cox transformations optimize normality, Yeo-Johnson handles zero and negative values, and transformation effectiveness guides selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Robust Multivariate Normality Assessment**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Robust methods assess normality while resisting outlier influence, providing more reliable evaluation in contaminated data\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Robust estimates reduce outlier influence, comparison with classical methods reveals contamination effects, and trimmed assessments improve reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Conditional and Marginal Normality Testing**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Testing conditional and marginal normality provides detailed understanding of multivariate distributional structure\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Conditional tests show normality within groups, marginal tests assess individual variables, and joint assessment reveals overall structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Sample Size and Power Considerations**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Understanding test power and sample size requirements ensures appropriate interpretation of normality test results\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Power analysis guides sample size planning, effect size measures quantify departures, and practical significance assessment guides decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Multivariate Normality in Subgroups**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Group-specific normality assessment is crucial for procedures like MANOVA and discriminant analysis that assume normality within groups\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Group-specific tests reveal heterogeneous normality, between-group comparisons show differential departures, and pooled tests assess overall assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Remedial Strategies for Non-Normality**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: When normality assumptions are violated, remedial strategies help maintain statistical validity and power\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Transformation effectiveness shows improvement, robust alternatives maintain validity, and non-parametric methods avoid assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Business Impact and Decision Guidelines**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Understanding the practical impact of normality violations on business analyses guides appropriate statistical choices\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Violation severity affects analysis validity, business impact assessment guides remedial actions, and practical guidelines inform statistical decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Comprehensive assessment of multivariate normality assumptions in customer data\n",
    "- Identification of specific types and sources of non-normality\n",
    "- Appropriate transformation and remedial strategies for assumption violations\n",
    "- Robust statistical inference methods that handle non-normal distributions\n",
    "- Business-relevant guidelines for managing normality assumptions in customer analysis\n"
