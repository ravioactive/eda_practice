    "# Canonical Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Purpose\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive canonical correlation analysis to explore and quantify relationships between two sets of variables in customer data. Canonical correlation extends simple correlation to the multivariate case, identifying linear combinations of variables in each set that are maximally correlated, providing powerful insights into complex relationships between customer characteristics and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comprehensive Analysis Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Classical Canonical Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Classical CCA finds linear combinations of variables that maximize correlation between two sets, revealing underlying relationship structures\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Canonical correlations show association strength, canonical variables represent optimal linear combinations, and significance tests assess relationship importance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Canonical Variable Interpretation**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Understanding canonical variables through loadings and weights provides interpretable insights into the nature of relationships between variable sets\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Canonical loadings show variable-canonical variable correlations, canonical weights indicate variable contributions, and structure coefficients reveal interpretation patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Redundancy Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Redundancy analysis quantifies how much variance in one set is explained by canonical variables from the other set\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Redundancy indices show explained variance proportions, asymmetric measures reveal directional relationships, and practical significance assessment guides interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Canonical Correlation Significance Testing**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Statistical tests determine which canonical correlations are significantly different from zero and assess overall relationship significance\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Wilks' Lambda tests overall significance, individual canonical correlation tests show specific relationships, and sequential testing identifies meaningful dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Robust Canonical Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Robust methods provide reliable canonical correlation analysis that resists outlier influence and distributional violations\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Robust canonical correlations show stable relationships, comparison with classical methods reveals outlier influence, and resistant estimates improve reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Regularization techniques handle high-dimensional data and multicollinearity while maintaining canonical correlation benefits\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Regularization parameters control model complexity, sparse canonical variables improve interpretability, and cross-validation optimizes regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Canonical Correlation Diagnostics**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Diagnostic procedures assess model adequacy, identify influential observations, and validate canonical correlation assumptions\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Residual analysis reveals model fit, influence measures identify problematic observations, and assumption testing guides model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Cross-Validation and Stability Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Cross-validation and stability analysis ensure canonical correlation results are reliable and generalizable across different samples\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Cross-validated correlations show stability, bootstrap confidence intervals indicate uncertainty, and replication analysis confirms findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Canonical Correlation Visualization**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Visualization techniques make canonical correlation results interpretable and enable exploration of relationship patterns\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Canonical variable plots show relationships, loading plots reveal variable importance, and biplot displays show comprehensive patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Partial Canonical Correlation**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Partial canonical correlation controls for confounding variables, revealing direct relationships between variable sets\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Partial canonical correlations show direct relationships, comparison with simple canonical correlations reveals confounding effects, and controlled analysis improves validity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Canonical Correlation with Categorical Variables**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Extensions to handle categorical variables enable canonical correlation analysis with mixed variable types in customer data\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Categorical variable encoding affects results, optimal scaling techniques handle mixed types, and interpretation considers variable types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Dynamic and Time-Varying Canonical Correlation**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Time-varying canonical correlation reveals how relationships between variable sets evolve over time in customer data\n",
