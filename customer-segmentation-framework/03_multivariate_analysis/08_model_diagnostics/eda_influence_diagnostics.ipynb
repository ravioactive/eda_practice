    "# Advanced Influence Diagnostics and Leverage Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Purpose\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive influence diagnostics and leverage analysis for multivariate customer models, providing systematic approaches to identify influential observations that disproportionately affect model results. It enables robust model validation by detecting customers or data points that may bias statistical conclusions and ensures reliable business insights through influence-resistant modeling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comprehensive Analysis Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Leverage Analysis and Hat Matrix Diagnostics**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Leverage measures identify observations with unusual predictor combinations that have high potential to influence model results\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: High leverage points show unusual predictor patterns, leverage thresholds identify problematic observations, and leverage distributions reveal data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Cook's Distance and Global Influence Measures**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Cook's distance quantifies overall influence of observations on all model parameters, providing comprehensive influence assessment\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: High Cook's distance indicates influential observations, threshold values guide identification, and influence patterns reveal systematic issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **DFBETAS and Parameter-Specific Influence**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: DFBETAS measures show how individual observations influence specific model parameters, enabling targeted influence assessment\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Large DFBETAS indicate parameter-specific influence, sign patterns show influence direction, and parameter-wise analysis guides interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **DFFITS and Fitted Value Influence**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: DFFITS measures assess how observations influence their own fitted values, revealing prediction-specific influence patterns\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: High DFFITS indicate prediction influence, threshold comparisons guide identification, and fitted value patterns show model adequacy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Studentized Residuals and Outlier Detection**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Studentized residuals provide standardized measures of observation unusualness while accounting for leverage effects\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Large studentized residuals indicate outliers, statistical significance tests guide identification, and residual patterns reveal model fit\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Multivariate Influence Measures**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Extensions of influence measures to multivariate settings account for complex dependencies and joint influence effects\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Multivariate influence shows joint effects, component-wise analysis reveals specific influences, and combined measures provide comprehensive assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Robust Influence Diagnostics**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Robust influence measures resist contamination from multiple influential observations and provide reliable diagnostics\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Robust measures show stable influence patterns, comparison with classical measures reveals masking effects, and resistant diagnostics improve reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Influence Function Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Theoretical influence functions provide mathematical framework for understanding sensitivity to individual observations\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Influence functions show theoretical sensitivity, empirical approximations validate theory, and functional forms guide robust method development\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Jackknife and Leave-One-Out Diagnostics**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Systematic removal of observations reveals influence through comparison of full and reduced model results\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Jackknife estimates show individual impact, leave-one-out comparisons reveal influence magnitude, and systematic patterns indicate problematic groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Case Deletion and Subset Analysis**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Strategic deletion of influential observations or subsets reveals model stability and validates conclusion robustness\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Deletion effects show sensitivity, subset analysis reveals group influences, and stability assessment guides model reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Influence Pattern Recognition and Clustering**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Systematic analysis of influence patterns identifies groups of influential observations and reveals underlying data structure\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Influence clusters show systematic effects, pattern recognition reveals data quality issues, and clustering guides targeted analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Business Context Influence Interpretation**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Translation of statistical influence measures into business context reveals exceptional customers or market conditions\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Business-relevant influential observations may represent opportunities, systematic influence patterns indicate market segments, and exceptional cases guide strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Model Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis**\n",
