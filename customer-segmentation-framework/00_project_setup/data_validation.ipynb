    "### **1. Data Structure Validation**\n",
    "- **Schema Verification**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Ensures data types match expected formats and business requirements\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Mismatched types indicate data quality issues or preprocessing needs\n",
    "- **Column Completeness Check**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Verifies all expected variables are present for analysis\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Missing columns may require data collection or feature engineering\n",
    "- **Data Dimensionality Assessment**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Confirms dataset size meets statistical power requirements\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Small datasets may limit analysis scope and statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Missing Data Analysis**\n",
    "- **Missing Data Patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Understanding missingness mechanism guides imputation strategy\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** MCAR allows simple imputation; MAR/MNAR require sophisticated methods\n",
    "- **Missing Data Visualization**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Visual patterns reveal systematic data collection issues\n",

    "  - **Importance:** Extreme values may indicate data entry errors vs genuine observations\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Systematic outliers suggest measurement or recording problems\n",
    "- **Data Consistency Checks**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Inconsistent values undermine analysis reliability\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Inconsistencies require data cleaning or exclusion decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Business Logic Validation**\n",
    "- **Range and Boundary Checks**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Values outside expected ranges indicate data quality issues\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Out-of-range values may be errors or require special handling\n",
    "- **Cross-Variable Consistency**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Related variables should show logical relationships\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Inconsistent relationships suggest data integrity problems\n",
    "- **Temporal Consistency (if applicable)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Time-related data should follow logical sequences\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Temporal inconsistencies indicate data collection or processing errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Statistical Assumptions Preliminary Check**\n",
    "- **Distribution Shape Assessment**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Understanding distributions guides appropriate statistical methods\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Non-normal distributions may require transformation or non-parametric methods\n",
    "- **Variance Homogeneity Screening**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Equal variances are required for many statistical tests\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Heteroscedasticity may require robust methods or transformations\n",
    "- **Independence Assumption Verification**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Statistical tests assume independent observations\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Dependence structures require specialized analytical approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Data Completeness Report**\n",
    "- **Coverage Assessment by Variable**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Identifies variables with insufficient data for analysis\n",
