    "- **Little's MCAR Test**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Formal statistical test for completely random missingness\n",

    "- **Missing Data Randomness Tests**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Evaluates whether missingness is related to observed variable values\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Significant tests indicate missingness depends on observed data, violating MCAR assumption\n",
