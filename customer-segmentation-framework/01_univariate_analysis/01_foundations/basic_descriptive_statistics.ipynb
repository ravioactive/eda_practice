    "\n",
    "## **üéØ Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides comprehensive descriptive statistical analysis of individual customer variables, establishing the fundamental statistical characteristics that form the foundation for all subsequent analyses. Descriptive statistics reveal the essential nature of customer data and guide analytical strategy decisions.\n",

    "## **üîç Comprehensive Analysis Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Central Tendency Measures**\n",
    "- **Mean Analysis (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Provides the average value representing typical customer characteristics\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High means indicate affluent/older customers; low means suggest younger/budget-conscious segments\n",
    "- **Median Analysis**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Robust central measure unaffected by extreme values\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Large mean-median differences indicate skewed distributions; similar values suggest symmetric data\n",
    "- **Mode Identification**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Reveals most common customer characteristics\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Multiple modes suggest distinct customer subgroups; single mode indicates homogeneous population\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Variability and Spread Measures**\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation and Variance**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Quantifies customer diversity and market heterogeneity\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High variability indicates diverse customer base; low variability suggests homogeneous market\n",
    "- **Range and Interquartile Range (IQR)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Shows the span of customer characteristics and middle 50% spread\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Wide ranges indicate diverse markets; narrow ranges suggest focused customer segments\n",
    "- **Coefficient of Variation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Enables comparison of variability across different scales\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High CV indicates high relative variability; useful for comparing age vs income variability\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Distribution Shape Analysis**\n",
    "- **Skewness Assessment**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Reveals asymmetry in customer distributions\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Positive skew indicates few high-value customers; negative skew suggests few low-value customers\n",
    "- **Kurtosis Evaluation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Measures tail heaviness and peak sharpness\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High kurtosis indicates extreme customers; low kurtosis suggests uniform distribution\n",
    "- **Distribution Symmetry Testing**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Determines if customer characteristics are normally distributed\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Symmetric distributions enable parametric methods; asymmetric require robust approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Percentile and Quantile Analysis**\n",
    "- **Quartile Analysis (Q1, Q2, Q3)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Divides customers into four equal groups for segmentation insights\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Large quartile differences indicate diverse customer tiers; small differences suggest homogeneous base\n",
    "- **Decile and Percentile Profiling**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Provides detailed customer ranking and distribution understanding\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Enables identification of top/bottom customer segments and value distribution\n",
    "- **Five-Number Summary**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Comprehensive distribution overview with min, Q1, median, Q3, max\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Reveals distribution shape, spread, and potential outliers in single summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Robust Statistical Measures**\n",
    "- **Trimmed Mean Analysis**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Central tendency measure less affected by outliers\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Large differences from regular mean indicate outlier influence on customer averages\n",
    "- **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Robust measure of variability unaffected by extreme values\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** More stable than standard deviation when outliers present; better represents typical customer spread\n",
    "- **Winsorized Statistics**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Statistics computed after limiting extreme values\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Shows customer characteristics when extreme cases are controlled; useful for policy decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Categorical Variable Analysis**\n",
    "- **Frequency Distribution (Gender)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Shows the composition of customer base by categories\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Balanced frequencies indicate diverse market; skewed frequencies suggest target demographic focus\n",
    "- **Relative Frequency and Proportions**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Enables comparison across different sample sizes and contexts\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High proportions in specific categories indicate market concentration or bias\n",
    "- **Mode and Modal Class Analysis**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Identifies most common customer categories\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Clear modal categories suggest dominant customer types; distributed modes indicate diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Comparative Descriptive Analysis**\n",
    "- **Cross-Variable Comparison**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Compares statistical properties across different customer characteristics\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Similar patterns suggest related variables; different patterns indicate independent characteristics\n",
    "- **Standardized Score Analysis (Z-scores)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Enables comparison of customers across different measurement scales\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High z-scores indicate unusual customers; z-scores near zero indicate typical customers\n",
    "- **Relative Standing Assessment**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Determines where individual customers rank within the overall distribution\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Helps identify high-value, average, and low-value customer segments\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Statistical Summary Reporting**\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Summary Tables**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Provides organized overview of all statistical measures\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Enables quick comparison and identification of key customer characteristics\n",
    "- **Statistical Significance of Descriptive Measures**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Determines reliability of descriptive statistics\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Significant measures indicate reliable customer characteristics; non-significant suggest sampling variation\n",
    "- **Business Context Interpretation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Translates statistical measures into actionable business insights\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Connects statistical findings to customer segmentation and marketing strategy implications\n",
