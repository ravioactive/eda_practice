    "## **üîç Comprehensive Analysis Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Outlier Impact Assessment**\n",
    "- **Statistical Impact Analysis**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Quantifies how outliers affect statistical measures (mean, variance, correlation) of customer variables\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Large impact indicates outliers significantly distort analysis; small impact suggests outliers may be retained\n",
    "- **Model Performance Impact Evaluation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Assesses how outliers affect predictive model performance and customer segmentation quality\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Outliers may improve or degrade model performance depending on whether they represent signal or noise\n",
    "- **Business Value Assessment**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Evaluates whether outlying customers represent high-value opportunities or problematic cases\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** High-value outliers should be preserved and analyzed separately; problematic outliers may require removal\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Outlier Removal Strategies**\n",
    "- **Complete Case Deletion**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Removes entire customer records containing outlying values in any variable\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Simple but may lose valuable information; appropriate when outliers represent data errors\n",
    "- **Selective Variable Deletion**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Removes only outlying values while retaining other customer information\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Preserves partial customer information; creates missing data requiring imputation\n",
    "- **Conditional Removal Based on Business Rules**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Removes outliers only when they violate known business constraints or logical bounds\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Preserves legitimate extreme values while removing impossible or erroneous data points\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Outlier Transformation Methods**\n",
    "- **Winsorization Techniques**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Replaces extreme values with less extreme percentiles (e.g., 95th/5th percentile values)\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Reduces outlier impact while preserving data structure; maintains sample size\n",
    "- **Log and Power Transformations**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Applies mathematical transformations to reduce skewness and outlier influence\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Log transformation effective for right-skewed customer data; Box-Cox finds optimal power\n",
    "- **Robust Scaling Methods**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Scales data using robust statistics (median, IQR) less affected by outliers\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Reduces outlier influence on scaling; preserves relative relationships between customers\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Outlier Capping and Truncation**\n",

    "- **Regression-Based Imputation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Predicts outlier replacement values using relationships with other customer variables\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Preserves variable relationships; requires sufficient non-outlying data for model training\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Replaces outliers with values from similar customers\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Preserves local data structure; k parameter affects smoothness of imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Robust Modeling Approaches**\n",
    "- **Robust Regression Methods**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Uses regression techniques less sensitive to outliers (Huber, Theil-Sen, RANSAC)\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Maintains model validity despite outlier presence; automatically downweights extreme customers\n",
    "- **Robust Clustering Algorithms**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Applies clustering methods resistant to outliers (DBSCAN, robust k-means)\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Produces stable customer segments despite outlier contamination; identifies outliers as noise\n",
    "- **Ensemble Methods with Outlier Handling**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Uses ensemble techniques that naturally handle outliers through voting or averaging\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Random forests and other ensembles often robust to outliers; may not require preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
