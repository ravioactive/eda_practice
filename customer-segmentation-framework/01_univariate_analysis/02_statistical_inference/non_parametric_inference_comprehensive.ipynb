    "\n",
    "## **üéØ Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements comprehensive non-parametric statistical inference methods for customer segmentation analysis, providing robust analytical approaches that don't require distributional assumptions. Non-parametric methods are essential when customer data violates normality assumptions, contains outliers, or exhibits complex distributional patterns that parametric methods cannot handle effectively.\n",
