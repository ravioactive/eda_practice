    "\n",
    "## **üéØ Notebook Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook establishes a comprehensive hypothesis testing framework for customer segmentation variables, implementing rigorous statistical inference methods to test specific business hypotheses about customer characteristics. Hypothesis testing provides the statistical foundation for evidence-based business decision making.\n",

    "## **üîç Comprehensive Analysis Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. One-Sample Hypothesis Tests**\n",
    "- **One-Sample T-Test (Age, Income, Spending Score)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests if customer means differ significantly from population benchmarks or business targets\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** p < 0.05 indicates customer base differs from benchmark; effect size shows practical significance\n",
    "- **One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Non-parametric alternative when normality assumptions are violated\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** More robust than t-test for skewed distributions; tests median differences from hypothesized values\n",
    "- **One-Sample Proportion Test (Gender Distribution)**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests if customer gender distribution differs from expected market proportions\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Significant results indicate biased customer acquisition or market positioning effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Normality Testing for Test Selection**\n",
    "- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Most powerful test for normality with small to moderate sample sizes\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** p > 0.05 supports normality assumption; p < 0.05 suggests non-parametric methods needed\n",
    "- **Anderson-Darling Test**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Sensitive to deviations in distribution tails\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Better at detecting tail deviations than other normality tests; critical for extreme value analysis\n",
    "- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests goodness-of-fit to any specified distribution\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Versatile test for comparing customer distributions to theoretical models or benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Effect Size Calculation and Interpretation**\n",
    "- **Cohen's d for Mean Differences**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Quantifies practical significance beyond statistical significance\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** d = 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), 0.8 (large effect); guides business impact assessment\n",
    "- **Glass's Delta for Unequal Variances**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Effect size measure when groups have different variabilities\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Uses control group standard deviation; appropriate when comparing to external benchmarks\n",
    "- **Hedge's g for Bias Correction**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Corrects Cohen's d for small sample bias\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** More accurate effect size for smaller customer samples; preferred for precise business decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Power Analysis and Sample Size Planning**\n",
    "- **Statistical Power Calculation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Determines probability of detecting true effects if they exist\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Power > 0.80 considered adequate; low power may miss important business effects\n",
    "- **Sample Size Requirements for Desired Power**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Guides data collection decisions and resource allocation\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Larger effect sizes require smaller samples; smaller effects need larger customer datasets\n",
    "- **Post-Hoc Power Analysis**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Evaluates adequacy of current sample for detecting observed effects\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Low post-hoc power suggests need for larger samples or different analytical approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Multiple Testing Correction**\n",
    "- **Bonferroni Correction**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Controls family-wise error rate when testing multiple hypotheses\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** More conservative p-values; reduces false discoveries but may miss true effects\n",
    "- **False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Controls expected proportion of false discoveries among rejected hypotheses\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Less conservative than Bonferroni; better balance between discovery and false positives\n",
    "- **Holm-Bonferroni Sequential Method**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** More powerful than standard Bonferroni while controlling family-wise error\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Tests hypotheses sequentially; stops when first non-significant result encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Robust Hypothesis Testing Methods**\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Distribution-free method that doesn't require normality assumptions\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Resampling-based p-values more reliable for non-normal customer data\n",
    "- **Permutation Tests**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Exact tests that don't rely on distributional assumptions\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Particularly useful for small samples or unusual customer distributions\n",
    "- **Trimmed Mean Tests**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Tests central tendency while reducing outlier influence\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** More representative of typical customers when extreme values present\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Bayesian Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "- **Bayes Factor Calculation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Quantifies evidence for null vs alternative hypotheses\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** BF > 3 moderate evidence for alternative; BF > 10 strong evidence; enables evidence accumulation\n",
    "- **Credible Intervals for Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Bayesian alternative to confidence intervals with direct probability interpretation\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** 95% credible interval contains true parameter with 95% probability\n",
    "- **Prior Sensitivity Analysis**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Evaluates robustness of Bayesian conclusions to prior assumptions\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Stable conclusions across priors indicate data-driven results; sensitivity suggests prior influence\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Practical Significance Assessment**\n",
    "- **Minimum Detectable Effect Size**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Determines smallest practically meaningful difference the test can detect\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Helps set realistic expectations and interpret non-significant results\n",
    "- **Confidence Intervals for Effect Sizes**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Provides uncertainty bounds around effect size estimates\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Wide intervals indicate uncertain effect sizes; narrow intervals suggest precise estimates\n",
    "- **Clinical vs Statistical Significance**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Distinguishes between statistically detectable and business-meaningful differences\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Large samples may detect trivial differences; small samples may miss important effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Hypothesis Testing Reporting and Interpretation**\n",
    "- **Complete Statistical Reporting**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Ensures transparency and reproducibility of hypothesis testing results\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Includes test statistics, p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, and assumptions\n",
    "- **Business Context Interpretation**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Translates statistical results into actionable business insights\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Connects hypothesis test outcomes to customer segmentation and marketing strategy decisions\n",
    "- **Assumption Validation and Robustness**\n",
    "  - **Importance:** Verifies that chosen tests are appropriate for the data characteristics\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** Violated assumptions may invalidate results; robust methods provide reliable alternatives\n",
