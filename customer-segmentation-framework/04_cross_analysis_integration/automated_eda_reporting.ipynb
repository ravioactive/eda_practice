    "\n",
    "### 6. **Statistical Assumption Validation Reports**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Assumption validation reporting ensures analytical validity and provides transparency about statistical method appropriateness\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Assumption test results show method validity, violation detection indicates remedial needs, and robustness assessment guides confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Comparative Analysis Reports**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Comparative reporting enables systematic evaluation of different analytical approaches and model performance across customer segments\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Method comparisons show optimal approaches, performance metrics guide selection decisions, and trade-off analysis informs choice rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Visualization Portfolio Generation**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Automated visualization compilation creates comprehensive visual documentation of patterns and relationships for effective communication\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Chart galleries show visual evidence, pattern documentation supports conclusions, and visual narrative guides understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Recommendation Engine and Action Items**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Automated recommendation generation translates analytical findings into specific, actionable business recommendations and next steps\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Recommendation priorities show action sequence, implementation guidance provides practical steps, and success metrics enable tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Reproducibility and Audit Trail Documentation**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Comprehensive documentation of analytical procedures ensures reproducibility and enables audit trail for regulatory and quality purposes\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Method documentation shows analytical rigor, parameter tracking enables replication, and version control supports reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Dynamic Report Customization**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Customizable reporting enables tailored communication for different audiences while maintaining analytical consistency\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: Audience customization shows relevant insights, detail level adjustment matches expertise, and format flexibility enables varied communication\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Performance Metrics and KPI Integration**\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Integration of business performance metrics with analytical findings provides direct connection between analysis and business outcomes\n",
