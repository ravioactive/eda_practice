    "### Month-by-Month Roadmap for Phase 2 (Months 7-12: Ideal Candidate Markers)\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase builds on the core skills from Months 1-6, shifting focus to achieving ideal markers like publications, scaled projects, collaborations, and interview prep. Assume 20-30 hours/week, with emphasis on impact (e.g., open-source contributions, networking for referrals). Interleave skills for integration—e.g., tie research to safety/alignment. To leverage your planning strength, use a Notion dashboard for tracking (template: notion.so/templates/project-tracker). Mitigate burnout with bi-weekly reflections and one collaboration outreach/week. By Month 12, compile a strong application package (resume, portfolio, 2-3 referrals) and apply to AI residencies/internships (e.g., OpenAI Residency, Anthropic AI Fellowship—check openai.com/careers and anthropic.com/careers for openings). Milestones include measurable outputs like PRs or submissions.\n",

    "By Month 12, you'll be positioned for competitive applications. Transition to Phase 3 (Months 13-18: Elite Layer) involves stacking elite elements like novel research, GPU optimizations, and high-impact papers. For Months 13-18, follow a similar monthly structure but escalate: e.g., Month 13 focuses on elite RL (70B+ scaling, CUDA kernels); aim for NeurIPS papers, lab endorsements, and full-time apps by Month 18. Use elite boosters: Monitor OpenAI blog (openai.com/blog) weekly; pivot to gigs via Upwork if needed. Track in Notion for \"unicorn\" signals. If you need links/resources for this phase, let me know!"
