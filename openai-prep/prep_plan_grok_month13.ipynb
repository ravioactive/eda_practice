    "### Month-by-Month Roadmap for Phase 3 (Months 13-18: Elite Candidate Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "This final phase stacks the elite layer on top of prior achievements, emphasizing research-style contributions (e.g., first-author papers in top venues), GPU/performance optimizations (e.g., custom hardware accelerations), advanced safety evaluations (e.g., scalable red-teaming), and strong open-source signals (e.g., widely adopted repos with thousands of stars). Assume 25-35 hours/week, with a focus on leadership, grants, and visibility to create \"unicorn\" signals like cited papers or tools used by major labs. Interleave skills for high-impact synthesis—e.g., combine GPU optimizations with safety in research outputs. Leverage your planning strengths by updating your Notion dashboard weekly (template: notion.so/templates/research-portfolio-tracker) to monitor progress toward unicorn signals (e.g., citation counts, repo stars). Address weaknesses like impatience by incorporating peer reviews (e.g., submit drafts early) and isolation via mandatory collaborations (e.g., 2 outreaches/month). Use elite boosters: Monitor OpenAI's blog (openai.com/blog) and careers page weekly for evolving needs (e.g., new safety initiatives); if stalled (e.g., no pub acceptances), pivot to AI consulting gigs on platforms like Upwork for real-world experience. By Month 18, target full-time applications to OpenAI/Anthropic (e.g., Research Engineer roles—tailor with your elite portfolio, 3-5 referrals, and demonstrated AGI alignment). Milestones include elite outputs like papers, grants, and endorsements.\n",
